Module 19 - Build Restock Functionality

Here’s how the reset stock feature works:

- There’s an input field on the page that contains the URL to the Strapi back end
- When a user clicks the “ReStock Products” button, a call is made to the Strapi back end specified in the input field
- The result of this call is an updated list of products

Makes use of Strapi back end with Strapi API
